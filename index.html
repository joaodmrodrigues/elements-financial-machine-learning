Machine learning applied to finance and trading is often regarded with either skepticism and distrust, or as the ultimate tool to squeeze otherwise
hidden or hard to recognize profit opportunities. While I believe the second to be true, financial machine learning does come with complex challenges
often not present in other areas. These include the low signal to noise ratio, serial dependence and hidden look-ahead biases, regime shifts and the complete
lack of time-invariance of the data-generating processes, among others.

Finance and trading are not traditional sciences, due to the inability to perform controlled experiments on real systems. Also, due to the problems state above, 
finding statistically meaningful systematic trading strategies is a very difficult exercise. As such, often the best use of machine learning in finance 
is in uncovering fundamental relations, rather than hard-to-interpret statistical relations.

It is not my intent here to describe profitable trading strategies. Instead, this page contains a collection of ideas and expositions on the use of 
machine learning and statistics in finance and trading, often demonstrated with controlled experiments and synthetic data.
